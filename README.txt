	All final commits for each Prototype phase will be done only after phase completion and testing to help reduce 
	code conflicts and version control issues.

				-Prototype I

	Each team member will have individual folders to work on, which should allow members to make changes and commits
 	freely without worrying about conflicts from the work of other members. This should also make compilation for 
	final commits to MAIN branch easier after development and testing is complete.


***** FOLDERS FOR PROTOTYPE-I-DEVELOPMENT BRANCH WILL BE CREATED AND ASSIGNED AFTER TEAM MEETING TO DETERMINE MEMEBER ROLES AND 
	REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PHASE. TEAM MEMBERS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF ANY UPDATES TO README FILE ********
